## ğŸ›  Technologies Used

- Java 23
- Maven (Project Management + Build)
- JUnit 5 (Testing)

## ğŸ§ª Test Coverage

Tested classes include:

- `Task`, `Epic`, `Subtask` models
- `InMemoryTaskManager` â€” task management logic
- `InMemoryHistoryManager` â€” fixed-size task access history
- Edge cases: nulls, invalid IDs, reference independence, etc.
